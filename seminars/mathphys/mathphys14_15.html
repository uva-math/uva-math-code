<I>Title: On Many-Body Localization for Quantum Spin Chains

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: I will describe a proof of many-body localization, under a physically reasonable assumption that limits the amount of level attraction in the system. The construction uses a sequence of local unitary transformations to diagonalize the Hamiltonian and connect the exact many-body eigenfunctions to the original basis vectors.

<I>Title: Localization in the non-monotonic Anderson model


</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
Recently John Imbrie developed a method to demonstrate localization in many body systems. We apply a similar method to a tight binding multichannel alloy model, where the potentials may depend analytically on the random parameters, for example these models can be realized as tight binding model in Z^D with dilute randomness. Such models are only partially understood by standard methods, though it is expected that they behave much the same as the standard (monotonic and single channel) Anderson model. The goal is to obtain representations of the diagonalizing basis in the case of large disorder, we achieve this by multiscale renormalizations by Rayleigh - Schrodinger approximations. We state localization results which can be derived from the derivation. This talk covers joint work with John Imbrie.

<I>Title: Counting maps with tridiagonal random matrices

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: H. F. Trotter discovered that, as far as spectral properties are concerned,
GUE random matrices can be modeled using tridiagonal matrices. I will explain ongoing work
about using this idea to count random maps with fixed vertex degree distribution. In particular
one can recover, in straightforward way the connection to trees and labeled mobiles that combinatorialists
have discovered using very ingenious bijections. This is joint work with G. W. Anderson, O. Bernardi
and A. Miller.

<I>Title: Dunkl Operators as Covariant Derivatives in a
         Quantum Principal Bundle

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: A quantum principal bundle is constructed for every Coxeter group acting on a finite-dimensional Euclidean space E, and then a connection is also defined on this bundle. The covariant derivatives associated to this connection are the Dunkl operators, originally introduced as part of a program to generalize harmonic analysis in Euclidean spaces. This gives us a new, geometric way of viewing the Dunkl operators. In particular, we present a new proof of the commutativity of these operators among themselves as a consequence of a geometric property, namely, that the connection has curvature zero.

<I>Title: The Energy of Multi-Polarons

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: A polaron is an electron plus the polarization field it
generates when it is embedded in a polar crystal, such as common salt.
The polaron has been studied extensively for several decades, starting
with the pioneering work of Herbert Frohlich, passing through the
results derived by T.D. Lee, Richard Feynmann, and others. In this
talk I will briefly summarize the story behind the theory of polarons,
and will discuss several results concerning the ground-state energy of
multipolarons - the case where several electrons are put into a
crystal - first obtained by Frank, Lieb, Seiringer, and Thomas,
followed by extensions and improvements by Rafael Benguria and myself.
I will finalize by sketching recent results obtained by Benguria,
Frank and Lieb concerning the non-stability of multipolarons in the
context of a semi-classical approximation, known as the Pekar
multi-polaron.

<I>Title: Quasi Limit Cycles and Applications

</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
We develop the concept of Quasi Limit Cycles at the interface between the theories of limit cycles and quasi periodicity to include almost and pseudo-almost periodicity, almost automorphy, and p-Adic almost periodicity, in both the usual Archimedean metric spaces and the p-Adic (ultrametric) spaces.
We investigate the conditions of existence and uniqueness, stability and bifurcation, as well as the notion of quasi-isochrons. Illustrative examples include perturbations of the Poincaré oscillator and the Liénard systems under various external forcing.
Also presented is on-going research on the co-existence of limit cycles and strictly quasi limit cycles, the existence of quasi isochronous limit cycles, and most importantly the transition to chaotic behavior, possibly through coupling/synchronization of quasi oscillators.

<I>Title: Stochastic integral estimates in quantum mechanics

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: Abstract:  Stochastic integrals can be used to estimate certain action functionals
appearing in elementary quantum mechanics and simple quantum field
theories.  I will review how these action functionals arise, and illustrate in
simple examples how the estimates work.

<I>Title: A Functional Integral Inequality with Applications in Non-Relativistic Quantum Field Theory

</I>
<BR>
Abstract: Here I present an inequality involving functional integrals that provides rigorous lower bounds to the ground state energy of certain Hamiltonians that arise in non-relativistic quantum field theory. In this talk I will focus on the one-particle, massless Nelson model. After performing a renormalization at the level of path-integrals, I will arrive at a lower bound to the energy of the renormalized Nelson Hamiltonian, and will show explicitly how the large coupling behavior of the ground state energy is at most alpha to the power of four plus epsilon, for any positive epsilon, when a constant square root of alpha is put in front of the particle-field interaction term. This is joint work with Larry Thomas.
