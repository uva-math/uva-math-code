<I>Title: "Time evolution of quantum resonance states I+II" </I>

Abstract:

Let $E_0$ be an embedded (possibly degenerate) eigenvalue of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$:   $H_0\psi_0=E_0\psi_0$, $\|\psi_0\|=1$.
For "small" perturbations $W$ and $H=H_0+W$ we shall investigate the asymptotics of the (naive) resonance state $e^{-itH}\psi_0$ in the limit $W\to 0$<br>
I) in an abstract Hilbert space setting, where $H$ fulfills a $C^k$-property, $k>3$;<br>
II) in an abstract dilation analytic setting.

<I>A rigorous renormalization group study of a p-adic quantum field theory </I><BR>

This talk will be a progress report on an ongoing research project which is joint work
with Ajay Chandra and Gianluca Guadagni and which concerns a p-adic analog of the
Brydges-Mitter-Scoppola phi-4 model with fractional Laplacian in 3 dimensions. The goal is to develop
a mathematical theory of the renormalization group which allows the construction of
field theory models in the continuum and the analysis of the short and long distance
behavior of the correlation functions. The p-adic model is used as a case study for the development
of such a theory, since it is considerably simpler than the model over the reals.

In this series of lectures I will explain in detail a new convergent combinatorial expansion method for the ground state energy of the spin-Boson model.  If time permits, I will also treat Euclidean correlation functions.
The spin-Boson model is a very simple, yet very rich, model in quantum physics which describes the interaction
of a two-state system with a radiation field. The situation I will address is that when the strength of this
interaction or coupling is small.

<I>Equilibration in quantum systems: an approach with polymer expansions</I><BR>

Consider a quantum spin interacting with a free boson field
(spin-boson model).
Physical wisdom dictates that the spin will be thermalized by the
field, i.e., it will assume the temperature of the field, regardless
of its original state.
In the last decade, this problem has been intensively studied in the
mathematical physics community. With the help of tools like spectral
perturbation theory, Mourre theory, and spectral renormalization
group, one has been able to prove thermalization rigorously.
We attack this problem with a different technique,namely resummation
of Feynman diagrams. Our approach is inspired by the fact that, for
weak coupling, the evolution of the spin is nearly markovian and we
set up the expansion around the  markovian limit.   This allows us to
obtain stronger results than those previously known, and we hope that
this technique will yield asymptotic completeness for the massless
spin-boson model.

<I>Clark-Ocone formula and central limit theorems for the Brownian local time increments </I><BR>

The purpose of this talk is to discuss some applications of the Clark-Ocone representation formula.
This formula provides an explicit expression for the stochastic integral representation of functionals
of the Brownian motion in terms of the derivative in the sense of Malliavin calculus. We will compare this
formula with the classical Ito formula and we will discuss its application to derive a central limit theorem
for the modulus of continuity in the space variable of the Brownian local time increments.

Generically an embedded eigenvalue of a self-adjoint operator disappears under small perturbations.  In this talk

<I>Exact asymptotic behavior of the Pekar--Tomasevich functional </I><BR>

An explicit asymptotic expression for the ground--state energy of the Pekar--Tomasevich functional for the
N--polaron is found, when the repulsion parameter $U$ of the electrons satisfies the inequality
$0 \leq U \leq 2\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the coupling constant of the polaron. If $\mathcal{E}_U^N$ denotes this
ground--state energy for the case of $N$ electrons and repulsion parameter $U$, we prove that
$\mathcal{E}_U^N/N^3 \to -c_p(U - 2\alpha)^2/4$ as $N \to \infty$, where,  $c_p = 0.10851\dots$.
Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{E}_0^N = -c_p\alpha^2N^3$, for all $N$.
