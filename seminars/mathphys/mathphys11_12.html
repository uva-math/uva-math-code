<BR>
<I>Title:
Quantum Noise and the Entanglement Entropy
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
Entanglement entropy is a measure of quantum many body correlations between the parts of a many body system. It has emerged as a useful quantity in broad areas of theoretical physics, from cosmology to condensed matter and quantum information. In this talk I will discuss the problem of entanglement entropy of fermions and it's relation to Widom's conjecture. I will also describe a universal relation between entanglement entropy and statistics of current flowing through a quantum point contact.  This relation provides a way to experimentally measure entanglement entropy, and test seminal results of conformal field theory such as the prediction of Holzhey, Larsen and Wilczek for entanglement entropy of fermions.

<BR>
<I>Title:
Diagonalizing a Matrix a la Newton
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
Newton showed how to solve an equation f(x)=0 by constructing a sequence of approximate solutions that converge rapidly to the answer. A similar idea can be used to solve nonlinear functional equations, as in Nash-Moser and KAM theorems. I will use Newton's method to diagonalize a symmetric NxN matrix with small off-diagonal entries. This will be an elementary talk which will lay the foundation for subsequent lectures applying the idea to Anderson localization.

<I>Title:
Anderson localization for Schroedinger operators with a random magnetic field
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
We consider a two dimensional Schroedinger operator with a spatially stationary random magnetic field in the plane and on the lattice. We prove a Wegner estimate, which can be used to establish
localization at the band edges of the spectrum.

<I>Title:
Time asymptotics of exp(ith(\kappa))
for analytic matrices
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
The results I will present are a joint work with Markus Klein. Our
interest in this problem has its origin in quantum resonance theory.
I will analyze the time evolution of exp(ith(\kappa)), where h(\kappa) is an analytic matrix
family. I shall derive asymptotic expansions with error bounds which are uniform in t and \kappa. In particular, these error bounds apply to the simultaneous
limit t -> \infty, \kappa -> 0.

<I>Title:
 Stochastic wave equation model for heat-flow in non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics


    </I>
<BR>
Abstract:
We consider the problem of constructing an invariant measure for
a one-dimensional non-linear stochastic wave equation.  The invariant
measure serves to describe steady state heat flow in a simple model in
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Rigorous quantum field theory functional integrals over the p-adics

<BR>
Abstract:
I will present the results of joint work with Ajay Chandra and Gianluca Guadagni
regarding the construction of probability measures on the space of distributions
over a three-dimensional p-adic space-time. The main ingredient is an extension of the renormalization
group methods by Brydges and collaborators to the case of nonuniform potentials.

<I>Title:
Rigorous quantum field theory
functional integrals over the p-adics, cont.

</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
I will continue this sequence of talks by describing how one
controls the flow of observables in our theory. If time permits I will
give a sketch of how studying the flow of one fairly simple observable
shows that the measure constructed is non-trivial (non-Gaussian). This
is joint work with Abdelmalek Abdesselam and Gianluca Guadagni.

Instability of resonances in the Stark effect for a simple model

This is joint work with Ira Herbst. For a simple matrix Schroedinger operator we present some (preliminary) results on the instability of a resonance under the influence of a small electric field in the weak field limit (DC Stark effect).
