<I>Title:
Proving Scale Invariance of a Massless QFT over the p-adics (I)
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
In a sequence of talks I will show how one can leverage correlation
inequalities and the theory of Gibbs measures to prove scale
invariance of a measure corresponding to a certain Renormalization
Group fixed point. Necessary tools include Griffiths' inequalities for
ferromagnetic Ising models, a result of Aizenman, Barsky, and
Fernandez on the sharpness of certain phase transitions, and
techniques developed by Ruelle along with Lebowitz and Presutti for
"superstable" interactions in statistical mechanics. I will give short
overviews of these tools and how we apply them. This is joint work
with Abdelmalek Abdesselam and Gianluca Guadagni.

<I>Title:
The Stable Adiabatic Time - a measure of stability of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
In this talk I will define the Stable Adiabatic Time (S.A.T) of a specific class of time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and I will build an appropriate bound of the S.A.T. with respect to the Mixing Time, which is more commonly known.  I will highlight some related theorems to place this result into a proper context and I will discuss the practicality of my result with some illustrative examples.  Although I will introduce some terminology for Markov chains and I will briefly discuss the Quantum Adiabatic Theorem, a good portion of my talk should be accessible to advanced undergraduate students.

The percolation approach to the quantum Ising model (I)

Abstract: We discuss the Feyman Kac representations of the d dimensional quantum
Ising model to derive a d+1 dimensional classical model, and
subsequently approach this model with Fortuin-Kastelyn percolation
methods. We will be interested in the phase structure of the
ferromagnetic Ising model with ergodically generated disorder.

<I>Title:
From duality to determinants for ASEP and q-TASEP
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
I will show how Markov process dualities for certain integrable probabilistic systems (ASEP and q-TASEP) imply that moments solve variants of the delta Bose gas. For special initial data, these Bose gas equations can be solved explicitly via a nested contour integral ansatz originating in the theory of Macdonald processes. Taking a generating series of these moment formulas leads to Fredholm determinants characterizing one-point fluctuations in the original systems. This provides a rigorous discrete deformation of the physicist's (famously non-rigorous) polymer replica trick (for KPZ equation). This is based on joint work with Alexei Borodin and Tomohiro Sasamoto.

<I>Title:
 Cluster Expansion for almost Gaussian Models I
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
 In equilibrium statistical mechanics it is quite common for a model to have a partition function that can be written as a Gaussian expectation of a polymer system. I will review some general results from cluster expansion and then I will prove a condition for the convergence of pressure and correlations expansions under the hypothesis that the Gaussian expectation has a finite range decomposition.
This is joint work with David Brydges and Dennis Timmers at University of British Columbia.

<I>Title:
 Story of an astronomical synchronisation:
shall we on a whim jump to another paleoclimate history?
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
The mystery of 100 kyr ice ages on Earth has drawn ceaseless attention for several decades. A very widespread school of thought assumes that these paleoclimates are paced by a varying incoming solar radiation (the so-called "Milankovitch forcing" by insolation). This phenomenon is clearly related to the synchronisation phenomenon in nonlinear sciences. A persistent hypothesis in the literature is the uniqueness of the associated paleoclimate history.  In this talk, we challenge that hypothesis by investigating in depth the synchronisation properties of a simple paleoclimatic toy model (a van der Pol-like relaxation oscillator). Our approach mainly relies on tools borrowed from dynamical system theory and clustering analysis. We show that, in a deterministic framework, the astronomical forcing may synchronise the ice volume to several coexisting climatic attracting trajectories, and that temporary desynchronisations may occur due to loss of local stability (positive largest local Lyapunov exponent). Additional disturbances may then cause a jump to another climate history over the last millions years of the Pleistocene, reducing the predictability of the timing of the glacial inceptions and terminations. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments confirm these results and precise them further. Such a conclusion about predictability is of major importance, because of its potential impact on the overall theory of ice ages.

<I>Title:
 Localization in the tight binding model: rough quasi-periodic potentials I
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
We discuss some approaches to studying dynamics of the tight binding model. The Fibonacci potential and the almost Mathieu operators are interesting examples for their intermittent dynamical properties. Although RAGE-like theorems are successful at showing delocalization, localization of the entire wave is much more difficult - especially in the case of non-discrete potentials. We will discuss in particular some results which generalize these potentials, that is piecewise continuous quasi-periodic potentials satisfying local Holder continuity conditions.

<I>Title:
 Infrared (and ultraviolet) aspects of a model of QFT on a static space time.
</I>
<BR>
Abstract:
We consider the Nelson model with variable coeffcients, which can be seen as a model describing a particle interacting with a scalar field on a static space time. We consider the problem of the existence of the ground state, showing that it depends on the decay rate of the coeffcients at infinity. We also show that it is possible to remove the ultraviolet cutoff, as it is in the flat case. We'll explain some open conjecture. (joint work with C.G&eacute;rard, F.Hiroshima, A.Suzuki)
