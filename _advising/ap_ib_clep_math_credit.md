## Key notes

- If you take a course at UVA for which you already have test credit, your test credit will be removed.
- If you have placed out of a course (without having received credit), you may not take that course for degree credit.
- Credits that are not course-equivalent (e.g., MATH 2000T) count as elective credits toward your degree but do not satisfy specific course requirements.
- AP/IB credit gives MATH 1310 and/or 1320 — these are **prerequisites** for the math major, not major requirements themselves. Prerequisites are not subject to double counting or transfer credit restrictions.

## Transfer Credit (College of A&S)

From the same Undergraduate Record page:
- Transfer credit granted for any course corresponding to one in the College curriculum, with grade of C or better.
- No credit for correspondence courses or work passed elsewhere by examination.
- Of the 120 credits for the B.A., at least 60 must be earned at UVA.
- Once admitted, students need prior permission from the dean's office to apply additional transfer credits.
- For the math major specifically: no more than 2 transfer courses can be applied to the major or minor (per `math_major_ba.html`). For transfer students, more may be approved by the Director of the Undergraduate Program.
