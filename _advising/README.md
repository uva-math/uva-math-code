# Advising Policy Documents

This folder contains reference materials and policy documents for math major/minor advising. It is excluded from the published website (the `_` prefix prevents Jekyll from building it).

## Key policy pages on the website

## Still needed

Pages to download and add to this folder:

### APMA / MATH prefix requirement (GAP in current website)

The Undergraduate Record states (see `math_major_ba.html`):
- **"At least 6 courses offered for the major must have a MATH prefix."**
- APMA substitutions are allowed (APMA 2130→MATH 3250, APMA 3080→MATH 3351, APMA 3100→MATH 3100, APMA 3120→STAT 3120), but they do **not** count toward the 6-course MATH-prefix minimum.

**This is NOT currently documented on the website's policy page** (`undergraduate/undergraduate_policy_page.md`). It should be added.

### APMA / MATH — still needed
- [ ] APMA course listings or equivalency policies
- [ ] SEAS APMA major requirements (to understand overlap)

### Double counting — other departments / schools
- [ ] College of A&S policies on majors: <https://college.as.virginia.edu/college-policies-regarding-majors>
- [ ] College minor declaration and policy: <https://college.as.virginia.edu/minor-declaration-and-policy>
- [ ] Types of majors (interdisciplinary list): <https://college.as.virginia.edu/types-majors-college>
- [ ] SEAS degree requirements / double counting rules (engineering side)
- [ ] Per-department guidance for common overlaps (CS, Physics, Economics, Statistics)

### Other useful references
- [ ] Transfer credit policies for math courses
- [ ] AP/IB credit policies for math placement
