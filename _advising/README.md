# Advising Policy Documents

*Last updated: 2026-02-09*

This folder contains reference materials and policy documents for math major/minor advising. It is excluded from the published website (the `_` prefix prevents Jekyll from building it).

## Key policy pages on the website

- **Undergraduate policies**: <https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/policies/>
  - Source: `undergraduate/undergraduate_policy_page.md`
- **Graduate policies**: <https://math.virginia.edu/graduate/policies/>
  - Source: `graduate/graduate_policy_page.md`
- **Double counting (current site page)**: <https://math.virginia.edu/content/double-counting-seas/>
  - Source: `undergraduate/SEAS_double_counting.md`

## Downloaded reference pages

- `math_major_ba.html` — Mathematics, B.A. program (UVA Undergraduate Record)
- `math_minor.html` — Mathematics Minor (UVA Undergraduate Record)
- `university_regulations_academic.html` — University Regulations: Academic
- `seas_academic_rules.html` — SEAS Academic Rules, Regulations, and Information (note: SEAS imposes no double counting limit of its own; defers to A&S department policies)

## Still needed

Pages to download and add to this folder:

### APMA / MATH prefix requirement (GAP in current website)

The Undergraduate Record states (see `math_major_ba.html`):
- **"At least 6 courses offered for the major must have a MATH prefix."**
- APMA substitutions are allowed (APMA 2130→MATH 3250, APMA 3080→MATH 3351, APMA 3100→MATH 3100, APMA 3120→STAT 3120), but they do **not** count toward the 6-course MATH-prefix minimum.

**Added to the website's policy page** (`undergraduate/undergraduate_policy_page.md`) on 2026-02-09.
