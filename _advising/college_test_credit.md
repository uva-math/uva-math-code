## Key Reminders

If you take a course at UVA for which you already have test credit, your test credit will be removed. Likewise, if you have placed out of a course (without having received credit), you may not take that course for degree credit. You cannot earn credit for the same class twice.

Test credits that are not course-equivalent will appear as 1XXXT or 2XXXT on your record (for example, BIOL1003T or HIST1000T). Credits that are not course-equivalent will not satisfy General Education Requirements, such as the First or Second Writing Requirement, the World Language Requirement, or Disciplines Requirements. However, such non course-equivalent credits will count as elective credits toward your degree.

## AP Exams (College Board)

Consult the UVA AP Credit Award Policy to find out how your AP scores will provide credit or advanced standing at UVA.

To request credit for AP Exams, send a copy of your score report from College Board to clasregistrar@virginia.edu.

Note: If you are a new student and it is the summer before your first fall semester at UVA, please have your AP scores sent from CollegeBoard electronically to UVA. The UVA code for CollegeBoard is 5820. AP scores will be downloaded periodically throughout the summer and you can check to see if yours have posted in SIS under "Test Scores". If they have not posted by mid-August, you may contact clasregistrar@virginia.edu for instructions.
