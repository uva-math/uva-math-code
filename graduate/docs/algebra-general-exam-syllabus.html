  <h1 id="syllabus-title">Syllabus for Algebra General Exam</h1>

  <div class="intro-note" role="note" aria-label="Important notice about syllabus changes">
    <p>This ("new") syllabus is a revised and updated version of the existing ("old") syllabus. Some new topics (such as symmetric polynomials, basics of representation theory of finite groups, elements of category theory) have been added, and more importantly, the focus has been somewhat shifted from certain topics to others in order to adequately reflect current trends in algebra. While these changes will help to better equip students with fundamental algebraic tools needed to navigate modern mathematics and streamline the coverage of general exams in algebra, the new syllabus will not take effect until May 2024 after the material has been taught in the graduate algebra sequence in AY 2023-24. So, the generals in algebra in August 2023 and January 2024 will be given based on the old syllabus.</p>

    <p>The material in the <strong>Standard</strong> category will be taught in Algebra I-II every year; it constitutes the basis for general exams in algebra. The material in the <strong>Additional topics</strong> category will be taught occasionally; not more than two of the additional topics taught in a particular year may be included in the syllabus of the general exams in the following year - these topics will be announced in May upon the completion of the academic year. This syllabus does not list the material which is considered to be part of the standard undergraduate curriculum (like groups and their (normal) subgroups, group homomorphisms and automorphisms, quotients and isomorphism theorems etc).</p>
