<h2 class="mb-3">Math Experimental Lab</h2>

<h4 class="mb-3">(formerly Geometry Lab)</h4>

The Math Experimental Lab is a mentoring and research opportunity for students interested in experiencing Mathematics in a more hands-on way. Undergraduate students are paired with graduate students, postdocs, or faculty for a semester-long project. See the <a href="{{site.url}}/mathexlab/projects/">projects page</a> for examples of projects which have run in the past. During the semesters there are various opportunities for the different groups to interact and for presenting the ideas behind the project to a wider community, like high school students from the <a href="https://www.virginiaequitycenter.org/starr-hill-pathways">Starr Hill Pathways</a> program, other undergraduate students from the <a href="{{site.url}}/awm/">AWM Student Chapter</a> or <a href="{{site.url}}/undergraduate/mathclub_redirect/">Math Club</a>, and also the Charlottesville community at the local Farmers Market. The mentors suggest general projects or media to use, but the details of the work will be decided together with the students.

This program allows students to learn and understand subjects not usually covered in the classes currently offered by the department. In addition, the students learn how to use hands-on activities to learn how to ask questions and start answering those questions which is exactly what research in mathematics is about, so for students interested in pursuing undergraduate research this is a great first step, together with the <a href="{{site.url}}/drp/">Directed Reading Program</a>. This program is also a great way to see if a math major is right for you.

<h2 class="mb-3">Requirements</h2>

The students are required to meet with their group and their mentor(s) once a week for at least one hour to discuss their progress and plan for future work. Additionally, two hours of independent work are required each week. We will also have monthly common meetings (three total) between the different groups. You can see the <a href="{{site.url}}/mathexlab/schedule/">schedule</a> for a more detailed discussion of the type of meetings, where students will have the opportunity to discuss their project with other students and wider communities.

<h2 class="mb-3">Apply</h2>

Applications to participate in the Math Experimental Lab open at the start of each semester. Click <a href="{{site.url}}/mathexlab/application/">here</a> for more information about applying.
