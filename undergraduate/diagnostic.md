<h1 class="mb-4">Diagnostic</h1>

<p>We are excited that you are interested in taking a math class at UVA! It's important to find a good starting place so that we can best support your learning.  We have a couple of questions to help you figure out whatâs next. </p>

## What Math courses do I need?
<p> First, you will want to think about what major you are considering and the introductory mathematics courses you should take. <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/diagnosticCourses">Here's a list</a> of some majors and courses they require. </p>
<h3 class="mb-4">Three pathways through our introductory courses</h3>
<div class="diagnostic">
<ol>
  <li>   <em>Do you need to fulfill a quantitative reasoning requirement and don't need a calculus-based course for your major?</em> We offer MATH 1110: Probability/Finite Mathematics , MATH 1140 Financial Mathematics, MATH 1150 The Shape of Space, and   MATH 1160 Algebra, Number Systems and Number Theory.  </li>
  <p>  The next step for your diagnostic for Path 1 and more information about these courses   <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/diagnosticPath1">is here</a>. </p>
  
  <li>  <em>Are you interested in business, biology, a social science, or need to fulfill  pre-health requirements?</em>  Path 2 includes Differential and Integral Calculus for non-STEM majors via Math 1190, Math 1210, and Math 1220 </li>
   
  
  <p>  The next step for your diagnostic for Path 2 and more information about these courses <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/diagnosticPath2">is here</a>. </p>

 
   
  <li>  <em>Are you interested in one of the natural sciences, engineering, mathematics or doing graduate work in one of the social sciences?</em>  Path 3 includes Differential Calculus  Integral Calculus  and Multivariable Calculus. We offer Math 1310, 1320 and Math 2310 for this path. 
</li>
  <p>  The next step for your diagnostic for Path 3 and more information about these courses  <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/diagnosticPath3">is here</a>. </p>
