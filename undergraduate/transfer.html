<h1 class="mb-3">Transfer of Credit</h1>

<p>Basic information about <strong>transferring credit to the College of Arts & Sciences from exams or courses taken at accredited schools</strong> can be found at <a href="https://college.as.virginia.edu/transfer-credit-overview">https://college.as.virginia.edu/transfer-credit-overview</a>. The College maintains a list of established transfer credit equivalences from US schools at <a href="https://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/asequivs">https://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/asequivs</a>. For courses not listed, there is a form linked at this site. (For study abroad at international schools, a much smaller list is at <a href="https://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/studyAbroad/Home/">https://ascs8.eservices.virginia.edu/studyAbroad/Home/</a>, and a pre-approval form is required.) The College's transfer credit evaluators (not the math department) make the decisions about whether to grant UVa credit and whether there is an equivalence to a specific UVa course.</p>

<p>If a math major student wants <strong>to count a course taken away from UVa <u>for a major or minor requirement</u></strong>, either a specific UVa course (like MATH 3351) or an unspecified elective (like MATH 3000TM), this must be approved by the undergraduate math director, and there is a 2-course maximum. The student should email the director with all the course information (description, syllabus, workload, grading basis, etc.) as well as the intended equivalent UVa course. Generally speaking we grant equivalence only for full-duration courses that match ours in terms of topics, sophistication, and workload. <em>We do not accept online courses for major requirement transfer credit.</em> After the director and student have reached an understanding by email, the student should fill out the form for transferring credit. Note that a math course taken elsewhere may be denied math major/minor requirement status yet still accepted for college elective credit (in the unspecified course case, this is denoted by T instead of TM, e.g., MATH 3000T).</p>

<p>Sometimes a student believes that he/she has <strong>mastery of the material in a course without having credit for it</strong>. In our experience UVa courses tend to be broader and more challenging than courses taken elsewhere, so we typically recommend that the student enroll in the UVa course to solidify understanding and have success (which is particularly nice in a student's first semester at UVa). However, students are not expected to take courses where they know all the material. If a student is interested in enrolling in a later course without having credit for a prerequisite, the student should work together with the instructor to determine whether to enroll in the prerequisite or directly in the later course. <em>Exception:</em> Prerequisites are not enforced for calculus; students place themselves directly in the appropriate course and may skip earlier calculus courses without instructor approval. There are some calculus diagnostic tools available on the math department website.</p>
