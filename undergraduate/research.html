<h3>Outside the Department</h3>

There are opportunities to participate in mathematics research&nbsp;at the undergraduate level. In particular, the AMS has compiled a <a href="http://www.ams.org/employment/reu.html">list of summer REUs</a> (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) that are organized at various institutions throughout the US.
