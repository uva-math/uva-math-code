<h2 class="mb-3">Directed Reading Program</h2>

The Directed Reading Program pairs undergraduate students with
graduate student or postdoc mentors for independent reading projects. Each
reading project lasts the duration of a semester and culminates with
the undergraduate student giving a presentation by the end of the next semester. The content of the
project is decided on by the student and mentor with the approval of
the DRP committee.

This program provides the opportunity for undergraduate students to
dig deeper into a subject of their interest under the guidance of a knowledgeable 
graduate student. For students interested in pursuing
undergraduate research this is a great first step! The DRP is also a great way to decide
if a math major is right for you.

<h2 class="mb-3">Requirements</h2>

The student is required to meet with their mentor once a week for an
hour to discuss their progress. Additionally four hours of independent
study is required each week. Finally, each
student will give a presentation about their project by the end of the next semester.
