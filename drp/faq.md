<h2 class="mb-3">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

**Do I have to be a math major to apply?**

No! Any student who has completed at least Calculus III (Math 2310 or equivalent) may apply.

**Should I already have an idea for a project?**

You are not expected to have a project in mind when applying. Your
mentor will work with you to choose a project that interests both of you.

**Do I get credit for participating?**

There is an optional course credit for participating in DRP!

**When do I give my final presentation?**

There is some flexibility here. Some students may opt to prepare their presentation before the semester is over and give it near the end of the semester or right at the beginning of the next semester, while other students might prefer preparing during the break and presenting sometime during the next semester.
