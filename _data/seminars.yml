    The Probability Seminar is the place to see talks on active research topics in probability theory, as well as informal discussions of basic notions of probability.  We typically have invited speakers every 2-3 weeks presenting a wide array of research in probability. Most other weeks are informal discussions led by local participants, often graduate students discussing recently studied topics. The seminar is open to all. Feel free to attend regularly or occasionally.

    The Undergraduate Math Club at University of Virginia is a weekly seminar and a club (with an official CIO status) for students interested in mathematics and related areas. It meets on Tuesdays at 5pm for 60-80 minutes. The activities vary from talks by faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students to presentations by local industries, panel discussions (on REUs, careers for math majors, etc.), and outside activities such as a movie outing or a visit to a 3D printing lab.
    <br><br>
    The Math Club is a students' space, and the CIO structure provides the Club with a managing board which helps plan and organize events.

    The graduate seminar provides, since the spring of 1999, a friendly atmosphere for students to give talks about their current interests, research, or teaching at a lower intensity level than that of other seminars.
    <br><br>
    The graduate seminar is designed with several goals in mind. Firstly, it gives students a chance to interact outside of class while providing exposure to some of the current interests of the department. Thus, graduate students in their early years can become more familiar with departmental areas of study, and are encouraged to boost their speaking experience by delivering their own talks at the graduate seminar. Moreover, it provides graduate students an open forum to practice giving mathematical talks, such as thesis defenses, conference/seminar talks, or final presentations, in a supportive environment.
    <br><br>
    The graduate seminar is intended for students so as to foster a relaxed atmosphere for discussion, which makes it easier for the speakers and promotes audience participation. Most talks last about 50 minutes, leaving time for questions afterwards. There has been a variety of topics covered: some students have discussed their research, while others have delivered expository talks that may not be related to their studies.
