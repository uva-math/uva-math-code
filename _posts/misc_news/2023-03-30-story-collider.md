The University of Virginia Department of Mathematics is excited to share an upcoming event, "The Story Collider Presents: Stories from University of Virginia."

Join us from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM to hear true, personal science stories from five prominent UVA STEM figures, including Sara Maloni from the Department of Mathematics. Erin Barker and Shane Hanlon will host the event.

Sara Maloni is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Virginia. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Warwick in 2013. Before coming to UVa, she was a Tamarkin Assistant Professor at Brown University. She works at the intersection of geometry and low-dimensional topology. More precisely, she studies deformation spaces of geometric structures on manifolds through their geometric, topological, and dynamical properties. Sara is originally from Italy and lived in the UK and France before arriving in the US. She loves hiking, scuba diving, traveling, reading, and crafting (felting, pottery, woodworking) in her free time.

The Story Collider is a non-profit organization that brings together scientists and non-scientists alike to share their experiences and the impact of science on their lives. This collaboration with the University of Virginia highlights the diverse stories of UVA's STEM community.

Take advantage of this opportunity to connect with the UVA STEM community and learn more about the personal stories behind science.
