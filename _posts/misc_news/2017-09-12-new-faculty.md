## Prasit Bhattacharya

Working in the area of algebraic
topology, Prasit Bhattacharya
researches computational aspects of
stable homotopy theory. Specifically,
he explores stable homotopy
groups of spheres, using chromatic
homotopy theory. He studies $v_n$ self-maps
that result in infinite
families of elements in stable
homotopy groups of spheres, and
his current research involves $C_2$-
equivariant computations, with a
focus on the telescope conjecture.

Bhattacharya completed his
bachelor’s degree (2007) and his
master’s degree in mathematics
(2009) at the Indian Statistical
Institute in Bangalore, India. He
completed his Ph.D. at Indiana University (2015).
Bhattacharya comes to the
University of Virginia from the University of Notre Dame, where he served
as a visiting assistant professor (2015-2017).

Bhattacharya has taught mathematics courses at all college levels,
including pre-calculus, calculus (at various levels), linear algebra and finite
mathematics. He enjoys mentoring undergraduate students as well as high-school
students. Bhattacharya hopes to continue mentoring students at
UVA and to teach courses at various levels while organizing graduate-level
seminars, as he has at previous institutions.

## Benjamin Hayes

Working with colleagues in the
Department of Mathematics’
operator theory group, Benjamin
Hayes researches topics involving the
measurement of how many finitary
approximations there are of a given
infinitary object, including: entropy
for actions of nonamenable groups,
free probability with connections to
von Neumann algebras and random
matrices, and sofic groups.

Hayes arrives at the University
of Virginia with a grant from the
National Science Foundation’s
Division of Mathematical Sciences
for his continuing research. He has
published nine papers, including
articles in Geometric and Functional
Analysis, International Mathematics Research Notices and Journal of
the Institute of Mathematics Jussieu. As a graduate student at UCLA,
Hayes earned a Dissertation Year Fellowship and the Heaviside Wealth
Management Award, which recognizes the graduate student who does the
best job explaining their research to someone outside of their field.

Hayes received his B.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington
(2009) and earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from UCLA (2014).

Hayes will be teaching an Introductory Real Analysis course in the fall and
Calculus on Manifolds in the spring. Excited to work with the department’s
operator theory group, Hayes also plans to explore possible collaborations
and connections with the department’s algebra and probability groups.

## Vivek Mukundan

Working in the areas of commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry,
Vivek Mukundan’s research spans
methods for computing the defining
ideal of the Rees algebra, studying the
invariants of powers of edge ideals,
multiplicity theory, koszul algebras
and other topics.

Vivek received his master’s degree
in mathematics from the Indian
Institute of Technology in Madras,
India, and a Ph.D. in mathematics
from Purdue University. Before
coming to the University of Virginia,
he was a visiting fellow at the Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research in
Mumbai, India.

Mukundan’s research grants and fellowships include a National Science
Foundation grant, multiple summer research grants from Purdue University,
a National Board for Higher Mathematics postdoctoral fellowship from
India’s Department of Atomic Energy, an INSPIRE Faculty Award from
India’s Ministry of Science & Technology, a Jawaharlal Nehru Centre
for Advanced Scientific Research Fellowship, and travel grants from
the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Research
Communities program.

At UVA, he plans on furthering his research in the fields of commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry while expanding his teaching repertoire.

## Liron Speyer

A postdoctoral researcher specializing
in representation theory, Liron Speyer
focuses his work on the study of a
fundamental object known as the
symmetric group, as well as several
families of related mathematical
objects. These include the quiver
Hecke algebras introduced in the last
decade, which have brought about a
surge of interest in the area.

Liron will be joining the University
of Virginia directly from Osaka
University, Japan, where he held a
postdoctoral fellowship funded by the
Japan Society for the Promotion of
Science. After receiving his Ph.D. in
mathematical sciences from Queen
Mary University of London, and his
master’s degree in mathematics from the University of Warwick, he held a
visiting postdoctoral position at the University of East Anglia, funded by the
London Mathematical Society.

Liron’s work has been published in Transactions of The American
Mathematical Society, Proceedings of The American Mathematical
Society, International Mathematics Research Notices, as well as three top
algebra journals.

This academic year, Liron will teach algebra courses for science majors, while
his research will largely focus on constructing a vast generalization of the
famous Littlewood–Richardson Rule in the context of quiver Hecke algebras.
