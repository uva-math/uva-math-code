This Dinner was conceived and organized by a former major advisor, Professor Gordon Keller, as a way of expressing the department’s appreciation for you. It is a great opportunity for all of you to connect with the faculty and other math majors in a relaxed and lighthearted environment.

In addition to a delicious dinner, there will be an awards presentation and a talk by Art Roselle, who holds a BA and MA in mathematics from our own department.  Mr. Roselle was Jefferson Scholar at UVA and won our E.J. McShane prize in 1992.  He is currently a partner at Pamlico Capital, which is an investment firm based in Charlotte, NC, focusing on private companies in healthcare, technology and communications.  His talk is entitled *It Was My Understanding There Would Be No Math*.
