Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field is in rapid development and there is almost daily news reports about how AI has revolutionized yet another industrial domain. Some researchers clam that within a few decades we will reach a so-called singularity in which computer intelligence will surpass human capabilities in all domains. Other AI-researchers, however, maintain that we have still far from understood the human ability to reach fast, intuitive and correct decisions based on often seemingly too little data. In the www.scienceathome.org project, we have developed games allowing so far 250,000 players to contribute to research in quantum and classical physics, mathematics, chemistry, behavioral economics, corporate management, psychology and cognitive science. We believe that this wealth of data from human individual and collective problem solving can be used to generate novel insights about human intuition and innovation that could potentially form the basis of novel forms of human-inspired AI.

Finally, I will describe our work within the new global educational movement, Think Like a Scientist, in which we introduce citizen science games to the formal school setting at all levels as a means to make the world of research and knowledge generation available to the students from an early age.â€‹
