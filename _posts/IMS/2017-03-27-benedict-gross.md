#### Lecture 1: The rank of elliptic curves

*Abstract:* Cubic equations in two variables, or elliptic curves,
have been in the forefront of number theory since since the time of Fermat.
I will focus on the group of rational points, which Mordell proved was
finitely generated. I will review the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-
Dyer, which attempts to predict the rank of this group from the average
number of points ($$\mod p$$), and will discuss the progress that has been
made on this conjecture to date.

#### Lecture 2: The arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves

*Abstract:* Hyperelliptic curves first appeared in work of Abel, who generalized
Euler's addition laws for elliptic integrals. Abel defined their genus $$g$$ as the number
of integrals of the first kind. Every hyperelliptic curve of genus g has an affine
equation of the form $$y^2 = F(x)$$, where $$F(x)$$ is a separable polynomial of degree
$$2g+2$$ or $$2g+1$$. Abel, Legendre, Jacobi, and Riemann studied these curves over
the real and complex numbers. In this talk, I will focus on curves defined over the
rational numbers, and will study the set of their rational solutions. Faltings proved
that when the genus $$g$$ is at least $$2$$, this set is finite. Using ideas of Bhargava,
one can now show that it is usually empty.


#### Lecture 3: Heegner points on modular curves

*Abstract:* In this talk, we will briefly review the theory of complex multiplication
and define certain special points, called Heegner points, on the modular curves
$$X_0(N)$$.
Following Birch, we will consider the divisor classes supported on these
points in the Jacobian, and will discuss methods that can be used to show that these classes are non-trivial.
We will end with applications to the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves over the rational numbers.
