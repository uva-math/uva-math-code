Congratulations to Gordon Whyburn Professor of Mathematics Weiqiang Wang 
on his invitation to the next ICM!

<!--more-->

Weiqiang Wang is a Gordon Whyburn Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia. His interests include representation theory for Lie (super) algebras, quantum groups, Hecke algebras, and Hall algebras. In particular, he is known for the formulation and solution of the super Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture in type BCD (joint with Huanchen Bao).To achieve this and go beyond, Bao and Wang have generalized Lusztig’s construction of canonical bases for quantum groups to i-quantum groups arising from quantum symmetric pairs. In recent years, he has developed a Hall algebra approach to i-quantum groups (joint with Ming Lu). He is a winner of the 2020 Chevalley Prize in Lie theory of American Mathematical Society (shared with Bao).
