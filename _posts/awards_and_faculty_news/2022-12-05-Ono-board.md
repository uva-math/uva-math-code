Located in Princeton, New Jersey, the Institute for Advanced Study has been the academic home of Albert Einstein and a collection of the world’s most influential scholars in mathematics and physics since its founding in 1930. There have been more than 8,000 members affiliated with the IAS, including 34 Nobel Laureates and 42 Fields Medalists. Ken Ono, the University of Virginia’s Marvin Rosenblum Professor of Mathematics, will join the IAS Board of Trustees in January 2023.
