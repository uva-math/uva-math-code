This honor is one of several accolades Koberda has recently received, including a Simons Foundation Fellowship and UVA’s Shannon Mid-Career Fellowship. His research explores the interplay between algebra and geometry, providing foundational insights that influence fields like cryptography, robotics, and materials science. Additionally, Koberda is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of mathematicians through his involvement in outreach initiatives such as the Vietnam Polymath Research Experience for Undergraduates. Ken Ono, UVA mathematician and STEM advisor to the provost, described Koberda as a “star” whose work exemplifies the excellence recognized by the AMS.
