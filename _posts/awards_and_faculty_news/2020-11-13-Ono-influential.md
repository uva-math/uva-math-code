Ken Ono currently holds the title of Thomas Jefferson Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia, and is also Vice President of the American Mathematical Society and Chair of the Mathematics Section in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Previously, Ono held positions at University of Wisconsin–Madison and Emory University. Ono completed his BA at the University of Chicago in 1989, and his PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1993.

Ono specializes in number theory, and is widely published, with over 160 article credits to his name. In particular, Ono is known for his expertise in integer partitions, which he has applied toward unraveling the work of famed mathematical phenom Srinivasa Ramanujan. Notably, Ono found a framework in 2014 that solves questions arising from the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. He also solved the Umbral moonshine conjecture, another Ramanujan puzzle. From this association, Ono is also considered an expert on Ramanujan, and was associate producer and mathematical consultant for the biographical movie on Ramanujan, The Man Who Knew Infinity.
