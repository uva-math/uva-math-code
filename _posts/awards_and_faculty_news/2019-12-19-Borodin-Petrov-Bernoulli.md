Probability and statistics are undergoing a substantial increase in both the breadth of scope and the mathematical technicality of many areas of specialization. There is a need for expertly written survey articles that will communicate an historic perspective on the successes, failures and general health of the area, as well as provide young researchers with a point of entry to the frontiers of the field. The Bernoulli Society plays a role in recognizing and communicating the importance of such scholarly efforts through a special award.

The Bernoulli Prize for an Outstanding Survey Article is to recognize authors of an influential survey publication in the areas of probability and statistics, respectively. The paper should be timely in addressing areas of active or emerging importance, but have been in circulation long enough for there to be evidence of its impact.

The award consists of the prize amount of 1000€ together with an award certificate. The amount may be adjusted in future years by joint request of committee chairs and approval of Bernoulli Council.

The combined awards are biennial. A paper in probability will be presented in a formal ceremony at the Bernoulli-IMS World Congress (BS-IMS-WC) in the summer of 2016, and a prize for a paper in statistics will be awarded in 2018, and formally presented at the ISI World Statistics Congress (ISI-WSC) in the summer of 2019, and each so awarded every four years, thereafter.
