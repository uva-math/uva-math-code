We had the opportunity to have lunch with Jing Wang, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Purdue University, and asked her a variety of questions from how the transition was when she first moved here to how she was sure she wanted to study probability. We discussed what influenced her to return to Purdue University and her opinion on the representation of female faculty withing her department. She also explained how a strong relationship with her adviser helped her figure out the topic of study she wanted to pursue.
