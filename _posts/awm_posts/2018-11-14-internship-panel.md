Joined together with the Math Club, students learned about various opportunities and paths they can take related to math. Whether you are interested in going to graduate school or have an interest in industrial work, the panel guests had many tips to help you start looking for internships.<!--more--> Here is a brief description of what they discussed:

Shannon, 4th year Math Major with Finance concentration
  * She had the opportunity to intern for John Hancock in the corporate finance division
  * During her internship, she worked with financial models and had many projects involving Macroeconomics and Excel
  * She believes her math background have her an advantage in her internship since she was familiar with Stochastic Processes
  * **Tip:** Handshake is good resource for finding internships and exploring events that are related to your field

Edith, Math Major with Graduate Prep concentration
  * She participated in a REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) last semester which she applied to through American Mathematical Society
  * Her Biostats research included a lot of self learning, but there was a lecture series and a lot of resources such as faculty that were available
  * **Tip:** If you don’t know where to start with REUs it may be helpful to even google different REU topics and pick out a few that really interest you

Trent, Math and Computer Science major
 * He participated in an REU through a different path than usual. He emailed the first professor on the math department page for research opportunities and it happened to be an REU
 * He also participated in a CS internship where he programmed and researched math
 * In both opportunities, he was given a lot of freedom to work on his own
 * **Tip:** Even if you don’t get an REU, you can talk to professors to help them with research

Tianshu, Math major 
 * She interned in an investment firm where she was able to apply what she learned in her Time Series class
 * Although finding an internship was hard, she notes that she learned a lot from her internships which included learning what she was really interested in.
 * **Tip:** If you’re thinking about quantitative internships, try to take Stats and CS classes because they will be helpful in internships and make you stand out.
