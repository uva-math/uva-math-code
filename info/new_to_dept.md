# New to the Department?

---

<h5 class="mt-2 mb-4">Welcome to the Department of Mathematics!  Below is some information to get you started:</h5>


- **University ID and Computing** [`http://its.virginia.edu/accounts/facstaffaccounts.html`](http://its.virginia.edu/accounts/facstaffaccounts.html) New faculty/staff begin here

- **Software Gateway** [`http://its.virginia.edu/software/`](http://its.virginia.edu/software//) provides access to site-licensed software that can be distributed to members of the University at no charge.  Our local IT person is {% include person_info.html UVA_id="vlb5y" %}

- **Setting up Direct Deposit:**  In order to set up direct deposit for your paycheck, you will need to have an account on the University’s Integrated System [`http://www.virginia.edu/integratedsystem/`](http://www.virginia.edu/integratedsystem/)    

- **Teaching:** SIS (Student Information System) at UVa.  Instructors use SIS [`http://sis.virginia.edu/`](http://sis.virginia.edu/) to generate class rosters and submit grades

- **Canvas** Course management system [`https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/`](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/) Instructors may create course sites with official class rosters. We encourage all instructors to load their syllabus and other coursework on Canvas rather than making copies

- **Books:** The Department will provide instructors with desk copies for their courses. See the front office (room `216`).

- **Graders:**  The Department provides graders for courses in the 2000-5000 level with good enrollment (> 20). Grader applications are held by {% include person_info.html UVA_id="rk8we" %} and {% include person_info.html UVA_id="eqg7fn" %}. You may search the applications, select a grader, and contact the student to confirm. The grader sees {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="zk4g" %} to complete paperwork.

- **Course Enrollments:**  Students enroll in their courses through SIS. SIS maintains waiting lists for courses and automatically enrolls waitlisted students as space comes available. Situations may arise when students cannot enroll through SIS, and need a permission from the instructor which is handled by SIS.

- **Scheduling Classrooms:** If your classroom is not the right size or you wish to reserve a classroom for a review session, makeup exam, etc., see the front office (room `216`), or use [the Source classroom booking system](https://25live.virginia.edu/). Department-managed classrooms (Kerchof 111, 128, 201, 314 and 326) are booked through {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="rk8we" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="eqg7fn" %}<span style="margin-left:-4px"></span>.

- **Copying Exams:** The Department has a copier/scanner (room `203`) and floor printers (rooms `313`, `118`) for printing. You should be able to print from your office computer (hooked up to LAN or eduroam wifi) to any of these printers. The Main Office (room `216`, {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="rk8we" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="eqg7fn" %}<span style="margin-left:-4px"></span>) can send large print jobs to UVA Printing and Copying Services. Please allow two days for turn around.

- **Telephone:** To make a call within the University, dial the last 5 digits of the number (ex. 4-4900). To call outside the University, dial 9 for an outside line. To make long distance calls, please request an FAC number from {% include person_info.html UVA_id="zk4g" %}. See information at [`http://its.virginia.edu/telephone/using.html`](http://its.virginia.edu/telephone/using.html). Telephone Counselor for Math is {% include person_info.html UVA_id="aab8b" %}

- **Advanced Research Computing Services:** [`https://arcs.virginia.edu`](https://arcs.virginia.edu), and in particular [Rivanna Cluster](https://arcs.virginia.edu/rivanna)

- **Math Department Tea Time** is every Tuesday and Thursday during the semester in Kerchof 314 (Math Lounge / Common Room), starting at 3:15.

- **Mailboxes:** Everyone has a mailbox in the mailroom (off the Lobby on the main floor).

- **Supply Room (220):** The Supply Room has paper, pens, chalk, toner cartridges, and other supplies.
