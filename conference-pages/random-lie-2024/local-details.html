<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2.5 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. The local airport code is <b>CHO</b>, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town (it is about 20 minutes/USD25 on Uber from the town). Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (<b>RIC</b>). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (<b>IAD</b>) and Washington Reagan (<b>DCA</b>). Flying to <b>CHO</b> would probably require a connection and may be less convenient, depending on where you are flying from.
<br><br>

<p>Random things to consider from far airports:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unfortunately, almost no direct public transportation or shuttles exist between RIC and Charlottesville. From IAD or DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a possible option. However, Amtrak runs only a few trains between Washington and Charlottesville per day.</li>
    <li>There exists Megabus service between IAD and Charlottesville downtown. See <a href="https://us.megabus.com/route-guides/charlottesville-to-dulles-washington-airport-iad-bus">here</a></li>
    <li>One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the conference, having a car is not necessary - the University and the town are walkable.</li>
    <li>Driving from RIC to Charlottesville is about 1h15min, and the drive is more pleasant than from Washington.</li>
    <li>To/from IAD, Uber costs up to USD200 one way, so a car rental is less expensive (your University likely has a special discount on car rentals).</li>
</ul>
