<h1 class="mb-5">RTG Postdocs in Geometry and Topology</h1>

With support from a National Science Foundation RTG grant, we expect to offer six 3-year postdoctoral positions
over the next few years. These positions are slightly different from the department's Whyburn and Pitts postdocs; in
particular recipients of RTG postdocs must be US citizens. Some other features of the RTG postdocs are:

* The position carries a teaching expectation of 1 course per semester.
* RTG postdocs (as a group) will also lead summer REU-style research projects with a group of undergraduates from UVa
and elsewhere. The summer programs will be coordinated by faculty and supported by graduate students, and include summer
salary for the postdocs involved. Each postdoc will be involved in at least one of these summer programs during their 3-year
appointment.
* Postdocs will be encouraged to participate in other activities of the geometry/topology group: seminar and conference
organization, mentoring of graduate students, and the RTG-supported regional collaborative research initiative.
* The RTG postdoctoral positions include an allowance for travel and materials (such as a computer).

For more information and details, please see the math department's job listings on [mathjobs.org](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/UVa)
or contact one of the RTG faculty.
