<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Conferences</h1>

##### Upcoming:

###### The Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar 

There will be a one day Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar at University of Virginia on Saturday, October 26.
 
Speakers will be:
 
* Maria Basterra (University of New Hampshire)
* Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
* Dylan Wilson (University of Chicago)
* W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
 
Talks will be held at Clark Hall on the UVA campus, likely two in the morning and two in the afternoon.
 
This seminar is the third such regional conference (following one here in 2015, and one at JHU in 2016), 
with a goal of bringing together the mid-Atlantic algebraic topology community.  It will also serve as 
one of the inaugural activities for the NSF RTG grant that the Topology and Geometry group at UVA recently received.
 
If you are planning to come, we encourage you to book accommodation early.  The seminar date falls in the midst 
of Charlottesville's annual 4 day film festival.  So one might combine attending the seminar talks and enjoying a film or two!  Information about this is here: http://virginiafilmfestival.org, though the film schedule only gets announced in mid September.  
 
Charlottesville is very pretty in October. Our restaurants will still have outdoor seating, and it is prime time for 
detouring through the nearby Blue Ridge mountains.  Using public transportation, we are accessible by plane (airport CHO) or 
train (e.g. two or three Amtrak trains each day from the northeast corridor).
