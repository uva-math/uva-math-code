<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry and Topology at UVa</h1>

Welcome to the home page for UVa&#8217;s geometry and topology
research group. Here you&#8217;ll find information [about us](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/people/)
and the activities we organize, including [conferences](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/conferences/), seminars, and 
reading courses. 
  
We will be hiring several postdocs in geometry/topology over the next few years, thanks to new grant support. 
Please see the [RTG Postocs](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/postdocs/) page for more details; we encourage you to apply!
  
Many of our activities are supported by an RTG grant from the National Science Foundation (DMS-1839968).
