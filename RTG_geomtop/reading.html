<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Reading Courses</h1>

Each semester one or more geometry/topology faculty or postdocs organize a seminar-style reading course for
graduate students. Usually these courses center around a book or collection of articles, which students study on their own
and present in course meetings. Current courses are listed below; more information can be found by contacting the organizer. 

Students are encouraged to suggest topics for future reading courses!

###### Fall 2019

**Floer Theory**: The first few weeks will be spent on chapters 1-4 of Audin and Damien's 
book _Morse Theory and Floer Homology_, which develop the construction of (cellular) homology of a manifold from a Morse function.
Subsequently students will independently learn about one or more versions of Floer homology: possibilities include continuing
in Audin-Damien to learn Hamiltonian Floer homology, related notions such as Floer homology for symplectomorphisms or for
Lagrangian intersections, or more diverse incarnations like symplectic homology, contact homology, instanton Floer homology,
monopole Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and variations of these for knots in 3-dimensional manifolds. 
Organizer: Tom Mark.

**Lie Algebras in Homotopy Theory**: A main goal for the course is understanding Gijs Heuts’ preprint “Lie Algebras 
and Periodic Spaces”, also surveyed in his article “Lie algebra models for unstable homotopy theory”.
 
In brief, in 1969 Quillen showed that the rational homotopy of (simply connected) spaces could be modeled by 
differential graded Lie algebras over the rationals.   The new results say that the '$v_n$-periodic' homotopy of 
spaces can similarly be modeled by algebras over the Lie operad in '$v_n$ local spectra'.

A suggested 'Reading Course Schedule' is posted under Resources/Fall19ReadingSeminar on the topology seminar collab site,
and some key papers are also posted there.   If you are planning to come to this seminar – and this hopefully includes alg top 
students - please look at this!

I (Nick) am planning to give a two talk overview, but after that we need (student) volunteers!!  Let me know what you might wish
to talk (and thus learn) about; we can also do some planning at the first talk. 

Organizers: Nick Kuhn and Julie Bergner
