<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Seminars</h1>

[Geometry seminar](https://math.virginia.edu/seminars/geometry/) meets Tuesdays from 2:00 to 2:50pm. Topics vary around
low-dimensional topology and geometry including 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, knot theory, gauge theory, quantum topology, 
symplectic and contact geometry, geometric group theory, dynamics, geometric structures, character varieties and moduli spaces.

[Topology seminar](https://math.virginia.edu/seminars/topology/) meets Thursdays from 2:00 to 2:50pm. Topics from algebraic
topology including generalized cohomology, chromatic homotopy theory, higher homotopy, category theory.

Both seminars typically host visiting researchers for lectures on current topics, but occasionally will have 
talks by UVa faculty or graduate students. If you have suggestions for potential speakers, feel free to contact the seminar 
organizers: Slava Krushkal or Tom Mark for geometry, and Julie Bergner and Nick Kuhn for topology.
