<h1 class="mb-5">Collaborative Research Projects</h1>

The geometry/topology group is organizing several ongoing collaborative research projects. Our goal is to involve faculty, postdocs, and
graduate students from mainly colleges and universities in the Virginia and mid-Atlantic region, in substantial front-line mathematical
research in geometry and topology. Projects will be led by senior researchers; the first round of projects were held in summer 2022 and 2023.
Another round of projects will be held in summer 2025 and 2026.

#### COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS IN ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY

The upcoming round of research projects will focus on three problems in algebraic topology. Research teams will begin meeting virtually
during spring 2025 before participating in an in-person collaborative workshop June 16–20, 2025, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The planned
projects are described briefly below.

* **Equivariant algebras and equivariant operads**
  - Team Leaders: Anna Marie Bohmann (Vanderbilt), Bert Guillou (Kentucky), and David Mehrle (Kentucky)
  - Description: There is a long history of using the theory of operads to describe the algebraic structures on naturally-occurring topological
    spaces, for example loop spaces. In the stable context, operads are used to describe multiplicative structures on spectra. In recent years,
    the use of operads in equivariant spaces and spectra has greatly increased. The interaction between the algebraic structure on an equivariant
    space or spectrum and its underlying object and fixed points provides a rich structure. This project will investigate specific types of
    equivariant algebraic structures governed by equivariant operads. Familiarity with other concepts from algebraic topology, such as spectra,
    operads, or equivariance, is welcome but not required.

* **Hermitian K-theory of motivic classifying spaces**
  - Team Leaders: Rebecca Field (JMU) and J.D. Quigley (UVA)
  - Description: About a decade ago, motivated by connections to character theory and chromatic homotopy theory, Bruner and Greenlees used
    the motivic Adams spectral sequence to compute the topological K-theory of the classifying spaces of many finite groups. In this project,
    we will investigate the motivic analogues of their computations, i.e., we will investigate the hermitian K-theory of the geometric
    classifying spaces of various finite groups using the motivic Adams spectral sequence. Prior experience with Adams spectral sequences
    and/or motivic homotopy theory will be helpful, but is not strictly necessary.

* **Cohomology Rings of Dani-Mainkar Nilmanifolds**
  - Team Leaders: Marco Aldi (VCU)
  - Description: Introduced two decades ago, the Dani-Mainkar construction attaches a nilmanifold to each finite simple graph. In this project
    we aim at explicitly calculating the Betti numbers as well as generators and relations for the cohomology ring of certain families of
    Dani-Mainkar nilmanifolds including those attached to trees. No background beyond standard graduate-level homological algebra is needed.

#### COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS IN GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY

The upcoming round of research projects will focus on three problems in different areas of geometric topology. After a period over the summer of
individual background study, the collaborations will kick off with a retreat workshop August 6–12, 2023, in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Collaboration
will then continue remotely through the fall, culminating—we hope!—in one or more research papers from each group. Potential participants are encouraged
to watch this space for further details on application, or to contact one of the organizers (<a href="https://math.virginia.edu/people/sm4cw/">Sara Maloni</a> and
<a href="https://math.virginia.edu/people/tmark/">Thomas Mark</a>). The planned projects are described briefly below.

* **Contact surgery, fillability, and quasipositivity**
  - Team Leaders: Thomas Mark (UVA) and Joshua Sabloff (Haverford College)
  - Description: A recent result shows that a knot in the 3-sphere has a Legendrian representative for which some positive contact surgery
    yields a fillable contact manifold, if and only if that knot is isotopic to the closure of a quasipositive braid with a certain condition
    on the braid expression. This has allowed the question of existence of a fillable surgery to be settled for all knots of up to 10 crossings
    by examination of braid expressions. We will warm up by considering the situation for 11-crossing knots, for which some of the obstructions
    used in the simpler cases may not apply. The main project will be to extend the quasipositive characterization for fillable surgery to knots
    in certain other 3-manifolds, particularly lens spaces and S^1 x S^2, with exploration of potential applications in contact and symplectic topology.

* **Parabolically geometrically finite subgroups of mapping class groups**
  - Team Leaders: Tarik Aougab (Haverford College), Spencer Dowdall (Vanderbilt), Sara Maloni (UVA)
  - Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13234
  - Description: The goal is to construct new examples of parabolically geometrically finite (PGF) subgroups of mapping class groups, as defined
    by Dowdall-Durham-Leininger-Sisto, by using right-angled Artin groups. The definition is motivated by the theory of geometrically finite Kleinian
    groups and is meant to generalize the theory of “convex cocompact” subgroups introduced by Farb and Mosher. More specifically, given a finite
    collection of multicurves that pairwise fill, the subgroup generated by sufficiently high powers of twists in the components of the multicurves
    should generate a non-free PGF subgroup. Beyond that, we also hope to look, more generally, for other sufficient conditions and also try to
    identify necessary conditions.

* **Fibering and Coxeter groups**
  - Team Leaders: Jean-Francois Lafont (Ohio State), Matthew Stover (Temple)
  - Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12906
  - Description: Right-angled Coxeter groups have long been fundamental objects in geometric group theory. They famously played a central
    role in Agol's proof of the virtual fiber conjecture for 3-manifolds, and this has inspired a great deal of work in recent years on connecting
    algebraic and geometric notions of fibering that were developed to study fibrations of 3-manifolds. This project will be centered around
    understanding recent breakthroughs by Martelli and collaborators that includes (1) the first hyperbolic 5-manifolds that fiber over the
    circle and (2) hyperbolic 4-manifolds with perfect circle-valued Morse functions. Understanding the tools used in these papers, this project
    will aim at answering questions left in the wake of these papers and constructing new and interesting examples, for example in the broader
    context of negatively-curved manifolds. Background in basic geometric group theory and hyperbolic geometry will be the only requirements.

##### Collaborative Workshop in Algebraic Topology (August 1-5, 2022)

The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers at various career stages in the Mid-Atlantic region working in the area of
algebraic topology, with the aim of fostering collaborations. Each of three teams has two team leaders who develop a research
idea, and three participants who learn background material in advance of the workshop. Each team continued to work
after the workshop itself and write a paper on their results.

The workshop took place at Good Place Farms in Lexington, Virginia, and was supported by the Geometry and Topology RTG grant.
