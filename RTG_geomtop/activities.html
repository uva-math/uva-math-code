Click on the links or use the sidebar to learn further details about the topics below.

* [Conferences](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/conferences/): We host at least one conference per year, in algebraic
or geometric topology (or both), including the Virginia Topology Conference series and the Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar.

* There are usually at least two [research seminars](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/seminars/) each week.

* The geometry/topology faculty and postdocs regularly run [reading courses](https://math.virginia.edu/geomtop/reading/) 
for graduate students and advanced undergraduates on special topics of current research interest.
