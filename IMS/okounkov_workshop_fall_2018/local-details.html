        The workshop coincides in time with the <a href="http://inauguration.virginia.edu">Inauguration of the University of Virginia's new president</a>
        which is on October 19 and 20. This implies traffic, parking, and access issues
        on Friday and Saturday - <b>please allocate extra time for getting around</b>.
        The red areas on the map (and maybe some additional parts) might not be accessible on these days. 
        Wilson Hall (the workshop location)
        is accessible by foot via the blue path or along Jefferson Park Ave.
        </li>

        <li>
        Everything should be quieter on Sunday - the best day to explore the beautiful UVA Grounds.
        </li>

        <li>
        If you are coming to the workshop by car and are not leaving it at the hotel,
        note that McCormic Rd is closed, and Emmet St S and Jefferson Park Ave should be open 
        (but with traffic on Friday and Saturday). 
        See parking directions below the map.

                Emmet St North, walk past the bridge, and then cross back to the sidewalk
