The properties of fibers of convolution morphisms are used in a variety of ways in the geometric Langlands program and in the study of Schubert varieties.  I will explain a very general result about cellular pavings of fibers of convolution morphisms in the setting of partial affine flag varieties, as well as applications related to the very purity and parity vanishing of cohomology of Schubert varieties over finite fields, structure constants for parahoric Hecke algebras, and the (motivic) geometric Satake equivalence.

                  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px"> Classical $q$-shuffle algebras provide combinatorial models for the positive half $U_q(n)$ of a finite quantum group.
We define a loop version of this construction, yielding a combinatorial model for the positive half $U_q(Ln)$of a quantum loop group.
In particular, we construct a PBW basis of $U_q(Ln)$ indexed by standard Lyndon words, generalizing the work of Lalonde-Ram,
Leclerc and Rosso in the $U_q(n)$ case. We also connect this to Enriquez' degeneration A of the elliptic algebras of Feigin-Odesskii,
proving a conjecture  that describes the image of the embedding $U_q(Ln) \to A$ in terms of pole and wheel conditions. The talk shall
conclude with the shuffle interpretations of fused currents proposed by Ding-Khoroshkin.
This is based on joint works with Andrei Negut.</div>

                  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra and $\theta$ be an involution of $\mathfrak{g}$. The quantization $(\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g}),\mathbf{U}^\iota)$ of the symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}^\theta)$ was systematically developed by Letzter where
        $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g})$ is the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group and $\mathbf{U}^\iota$ is a coideal subalgebra of it. We usually
        refer $\mathbf{U}^\iota$ as the $\iota$quantum group. Over the last decade, many fundamental constructions in quantum groups have been generalized to quantum groups by Wang and his collaborators.

        In this talk, we will discuss the super analogue of $\mathbf{U}^\iota$ and introduce one specific family which unites quantum groups (non-super) of type AI and AII. We will also demonstrate an Schur duality between this specific family and the $q$-Brauer algebra. This duality can be viewed as a quantization of the classical duality between the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra and the Brauer algebra. This is joint work with Weiqiang Wang.</div>

                  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">Abstract: The skein algebra of a surface is spanned by links in the thickened surface, subject to skein relations which diagrammatically encode the data of a quantum group. The multiplication in the algebra is induced by stacking links in the thickened surface. This product is generally noncommutative. When the quantum parameter q is generic, the center of the skein algebra is essentially trivial. However, when q is a root of unity, interesting central elements arise. When the quantum group is quantum SL(2), the work of Bonahon-Wong shows that these central elements can be obtained by a topological operation of threading Chebyshev polynomials along knots. In this talk, I will discuss joint work with F. Bonahon in which we use analogous multi-variable 'threading' polynomials to obtain central elements in higher rank SL(d) skein algebras.</div>

        the construction of vertex algebra elements that project to bases for subalgebras of $m$
        isomorphic to $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and corresponding to imaginary simple roots $(1,j)$ for $j>0$. The

For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition.

After discussing some motivation for the theory of symplectic singularities, we will survey some of the basic facts that are known about the universal hyperkahler implosion and discuss how they are used to prove the main theorem.

In joint work with Bill Graham and Minyoung Jeon, we analyze further the algebraic geometry of these resolutions. We prove that a family of small resolutions for $U(p,q)$ have reduced scheme theoretic fibers.

The localizing subcategories for the detecting subalgebra are classified which allows us to prove a nilpotence theorem and determine the homological spectrum for the stable module category of ${\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak f},{\mathfrak f}_{0})}$.

        These results on the detecting subalgebras are then applied with work of Balmer and key assumptions in work of Boe, Kujawa and Nakano, to provide a method to explicitly realize the Balmer spectrum of $\text{stab}({\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}_{0})})$ for Type I classical Lie superalgebras (with an ample detecting subalgebra).</div>

                  <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak g}_{0}\oplus {\mathfrak g}_{1}$ be a Type I classical Lie superalgebra with an ample detecting subalgebra ${\mathfrak f}$. In this talk, the speaker will consider the tensor triangular geometry for the stable category of finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra representations: $\text{stab}({\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}_{0})})$. The localizing subcategories for the detecting subalgebra are classified which allows us to prove a nilpotence theorem and determine the homological spectrum for the stable module category of ${\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak f},{\mathfrak f}_{0})}$.

        These results on the detecting subalgebras are then applied with work of Balmer and key assumptions in work of Boe, Kujawa and Nakano, to provide a method to explicitly realize the Balmer spectrum of $\text{stab}({\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}_{0})})$ for Type I classical Lie superalgebras (with an ample detecting subalgebra).</div>

                  <div style="background-color:#cbfaff; padding:10px">Abstract: The representation theory of quantum groups including at roots of unity is an important part of Lie representation theory. In this talk, we will study one of categories of representations: the quantum category $\mathcal O$, which is a suitable analog of the classical Bernstein-Gelfand category $\mathcal O$. We will relate it to a model representation category, the affine Hecke category, more precisely to the heart of the new $t$-structure on that category (all these terms will be defined in the lectures). The lectures are based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03153">arXiv:2310.03153</a>.</div>

                  <div style="background-color:#cbfaff; padding:10px">Abstract: Maximal commutative subalgebras of the Yangian $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ can be used to decompose its (tame) representations. One such family are the Bethe subalgebras, indexed by points in the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space $M(0,n+2)$. Over the real locus of this parameter space, a fixed tame representation produces an unramified covering. We will discuss the identification of each fiber with a collection of Gelfand-Tsetlin keystone patterns, which carry a $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ crystal structure, as well as the monodromy action realized by a type of cactus group.

Although they satisfy a version of the Dynkin--Specht--Wever theorem, Kharchenko has shown that such quantum Lie operations fail to be unique except in the bilinear or trilinear case. We will consider the classification problem for quantum Lie operations in more than four indeterminates, and the relationship between these quantum Lie algebras and their corresponding enveloping algebras.</div>

                  <summary>Linear Scaling Quantum LDPC Codes via Balanced Products</summary>
                  <div style="background-color:#cbfaff; padding:10px">Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code constructions that can accomplish linear minimum distance and dimension could make error correction in quantum computing practical. However, previous constructions were limited to non-linear distance scaling. In this paper, we describe explicit code constructions that overcome this barrier. We present families of quantum LDPC codes with parameters [[n, k, d]] where k and d both scale linearly with code length n. Taking the balanced products of expanding Cayley graph codes accomplishes this. The balanced product combines two chain complexes to preserve the desired properties. With a careful selection of Cayley graph codes, the resultant balanced product codes exhibit distance and dimension in linear form. We demonstrate efficient decoding using belief propagation and ordered statistics methods. Our constructions illustrate the existence of good QLDPC codes that attain the optimal distance-versus-length tradeoff asymptotically. This is a significant step toward the practical implementation of quantum error correction. </div>

The main goal of this talk is to explain a new approach for constructing the generalized Springer correspondence for H-equivariant irreducible perverse sheaf on the nilpotent cone of H. An alternative approach to this task was first introduced by Aubert-Moussaoui-Solleveld in order to construct the Bernstein decomposition for enhanced L-parameters (in the sense of Arthur)---a first step in a general strategy to reduce local Langlands correspondences to the supercuspidal case. Our approach lets us construct and study the Bernstein decomposition for L-parameters in the context of Kaletha's refined local Langlands correspondence, which this talk will also discuss.

We consider the problem in the super setting for the Hermitian symmetric superpair $(\mathfrak{gl}(2p|2q), \mathfrak{gl}(p|q)\oplus \mathfrak{gl}(p|q))$, and we prove their Harish-Chandra images are specializations of certain BC-supersymmetric interpolation polynomials introduced by Sergeev and Veselov.

                  <div style="background-color:#cbfaff; padding:10px">Abstract: Irreducible characters of the finite group $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ were determined by Green in a remarkable paper that has influenced representation theory greatly. In this talk, I will discuss a vertex algebraic approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$. Green's theory is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R(G)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} R(\mathrm{GL}(n,
        q))$
        as two isomorphic Fock spaces. Under this picture, the irreducible
        characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur
        functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are
        realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions,
        and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of
        vertex operators of these two types. This offers a simplification to
        identify the Fock space $R(G)$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric
        functions.
        We will also discuss how to compute the characters in general. This is
        joint work with Y. Wu.</div>
