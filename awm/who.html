### Who are we?



<span align="justify"> The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/home">Association of Women in Mathematics</a> has the purpose to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences.
We are the student chapter of the AWM at the University of Virginia. Our goal is to provide for all students, regardless of gender identity, to be exposed to the world of professional mathematics, to obtain information about the varied career options in mathematics, to network with professional mathematicians, and to develop leadership skills.
If you would like to participate in any of our events, check out our <a href="{{site.url}}/awm/calendar/">calendar</a> and just show up! If you would like to be part of our mailing list, please send us a <a href="mailto:math-awm&#x40;virginia.edu">message</a> and we will send you a message whenever we schedule a new event. You are also welcome to email us with any questions or suggestions you might have.
